@article{Koppelman2005,
abstract = {Choice-based samples oversample infrequently chosen alternatives to obtain an effective representation of the behavior of people who select these alternatives. However, the use of choice-based samples requires recognition of the sampling process in formulating the estimation procedure. In general, this procedure can be accomplished by applying weights to the observed choices in the estimation process. Unfortunately, the use of such weighted estimation procedures for choice models does not yield efficient estimators. However, for the special case of the multinomial logit model with a full set of alternative-specific constants, the standard maximum likelihood estimator—which is efficient—can be used with adjustment of the alternative-specific constants. The same maximum likelihood estimator can also be used with adjustment to estimate nested logit models with choice-based samples. The proof of this property is qualitatively described, and examples demonstrate how to apply the adjustment procedure.},

Recently, there has been a surge of interest in Tradable Credits (TC) as an alternative measure to manage the growth of personal car use. This paper summarises the results and methodologies of studies that have sought to anticipate the behavioural responses to several proposed TC schemes that target personal travel. In a critical reflection on this work and in an attempt to inspire future research, we argue that future empirical studies on TC behaviours can greatly benefit from insights from the fields of behavioural economics and cognitive psychology. Therefore, in the second part of the paper, we bring together behavioural concepts from these fields that are relevant in a TC decision-making context. Based on observations from current TC studies and the behavioural mechanisms identified in the second part of the paper, we propose promising directions for future research on understanding the impact of TC on personal car travel.}

@article{LizetKrabbenborg.2020,
 abstract = {Congestion is threatening the accessibility and liveability of urban regions. Cities are usually hesitant to consider the effective, yet controversial idea of congestion pricing as a measure to abate the growing economic and environmental problems. In the longstanding search for an effective and acceptable pricing scheme, there has been an increased interest in tradable credits. Compared to charging instruments, this novel concept has the theoretical advantage that it can better address equity issues while effectively reducing congestion. Although one may argue that tradable peak credits (TPC) lead to higher public acceptability, very few empirical studies have researched this. Therefore, this study explores attitudes towards TPC using five focus groups with Dutch citizens. The participants were confronted with a hypothetical city where two instruments were suggested: peak charge (PC) and TPC. Most participants preferred PC and only two participants supported TPC while opposing PC. The advantages as addressed in literature played minor roles in the discussions. Participants revealed a sceptical attitude towards TPC or were more convinced about PC. Contrary to expectations, the attitudes became more negative as the discussions developed. Based on these insights, we propose directions for future research to assist the search for an acceptable congestion pricing instrument.},

 abstract = {The idea of roadway transportation as a shared economy and next-generation of mobility services is increasingly becoming a reality with the premise that the roadway system is a collection of scarce commodities, which can be managed by endowing right use to its users. Over the past two decades, a growing body of research has explored different roadway-use right schemes, including credit-and permit-based mobility schemes, with specific focus on the three problems arising in these schemes--pricing, efficient allocation and charging of permits or credits for mobility management. In this paper, we attempt to synthesis the relevant body of literature by presenting an in-depth comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art methodologies for addressing these decision problems. The goal is to provide an improved understanding of the fundamental constructs, problem variants, proposed methodologies, and modelling attributes. We also discuss the research gaps and challenges and suggest some possible perspectives and directions for future research.},

 abstract = {Transport justice has two essential dimensions: (1) compensating for inequalities in access to mobility, and (2) mitigating the disproportionately burdensome negative consequences of transport. In light of the urgently needed action regarding climate change especially in the transport sector, measures reducing carbon emissions to mitigate the impact are inevitable. However, policy measures for reaching climate targets should avoid increasing unequal mobility chances. Therefore, there is a need for concepts striving to mitigate both climate impacts and transport injustice. The paper addresses the potential of introducing individual mobility budgets to achieve transport-related climate goals while reducing inequalities in mobility. The concept proposed in this contribution is based on a combination of qualitative and quantitative impact assessment methods including a stakeholder involvement process and transport modelling based on different data sources. The results provide policy recommendations as well as further research requirements, which are already partly addressed iin follow-up projects.},

We have analysed the choice to participate in a voluntary experiment, and the behavioural response to tradable permits. Our results provide suggestive evidence that active participants do adjust their behaviour as intended. Furthermore, participation takes less time than people anticipate, and permits are viewed as a fairer and better functioning alternative to paid parking.},

@article{Wadud.2011,
 abstract = {Personal road transport sector poses a significant challenge in reducing carbon emissions. This paper evaluates a policy approach known as personal tradable carbon permits to reduce carbon emissions from personal vehicles. The policy is a downstream tradable permit where individuals are allocated carbon emission caps. The policy is qualitatively evaluated in the context of carbon taxes and some upstream tradable permit options. The biggest disadvantage of such a policy is the initial set up costs. Personal tradable permits, however, are more effective than carbon taxes and are also capable of stabilizing the gasoline prices faced by the consumers when the underlying oil prices fluctuate. Since equity effects are often a concern to policy makers, the effect of such personal carbon permits on the distribution of burden is quantified in a partial equilibrium framework for the US population. Different permit allocation strategies are investigated in this regard. Using US consumer expenditure survey data, and incorporating a differentiated price response for different households, we find that all three allocation strategies considered are progressive: a per adult based allocation is the most progressive, a per vehicle allocation nearer to proportional, and a per capita allocation in between the two. Personal tradable permits therefore take care of equity concerns directly through the design of the policy. $\backslash$textcopyright 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{SusanGrantMuller.2014,
 abstract = {Road traffic congestion is not yet reflected in current market prices within the sector and has given rise to a number of instruments to mitigate the resulting negative impacts. The focus of this paper is the tradable credit scheme - an incentive-based economic measure - in order to address traffic congestion. The research questions are (1) whether the state-of-the-art in the literature suggests that tradable credit schemes could be feasibly introduced to mitigate congestion, and (2) whether a tradable credit scheme could have advantages over other instruments. A brief outline of congestion mitigation approaches is provided first to position this type of economic instrument with respect to other measures. The broad issues in the design of a tradable credit scheme are then presented. Most research to date has focused on the use of tradable credits to manage related pollution, but it is clear there is potential to design a scheme for traffic congestion management. To date this is a novel review of tradable credit schemes that has focused specifically on their role in road traffic congestion management. $\backslash$textcopyright 2014 Taylor 5{\&}6 Francis.},

Because budgets cannot perfectly anticipate consumption opportunities, people may earmark too much or too little money for a particular category. This leads them to overconsume or underconsume goods in that category. The results of three studies suggest that consumers do indeed set budgets and that budgeting may lead to underconsumption. To show that consumers track expenses, the studies demonstrate that budgeting effects are larger for purchases that are highly typical of their category. Such purchases reduce the amount people spend in a category and block the purchase of other typical items. The studies control for satiation and income effects; thus, budgeting adds predictive power to standard economic consumer theory.},

 abstract = {This paper studies tradable mobility permit schemes in a monocentric city with a distorting labor tax, considering spatially differentiated allocations of permits to households. Numerical results show that an allocation of permits proportional to labor supply reaches about 99.9{\%} of first-best welfare, clearly outperforming a scheme with lump-sum allocation of permits, and being more efficient than the second-best tax for levels of the labor tax of 20{\%} or higher. This is due to the welfare gains of incentivizing labor supply, which has an effect similar to the revenue recycling effect of conventional road pricing, and that can be optimized by the social planner by exploiting spatial differences. Other alternatives, such as an allocation of permits proportional to distance from the CBD and a cordon-based scheme do not reach those high levels of efficiency. Our results provide insights into the efficiency of tradable driving permit schemes as an alternative to road pricing to tackle present externalities, showing that a spatial differentiation of the allocation of permits can be a powerful instrument in the hands of the regulator.},

 abstract = {Recent years have seen a surge of interest in the concept of tradable driving credits (TDC) as an alternative to road pricing and driving restriction measures. However, empirical research into drivers' responses to a TDC measure is limited and even lacking for the Chinese context where the concept of TDC has attracted considerable attention. This paper reports the results of a survey that was the first to investigate drivers' willingness to change car use under a hypothetical distance-based TDC measure in China (Beijing) and aimed to compare these results with the results of a comparative Dutch survey. We observed that willingness to change was considerably higher in Beijing than in the Netherlands and that a substantial share of Beijing car owners indicated an increase in car use. In both contexts, higher education and higher car use intensity had a positive effect on the willingness to change, whereas higher income had a negative effect. We found mixed results for household size, respondents' car attitudes, and TDC scenario characteristics.},

Travelers' transport mode choice behavior (car or bus) and the modal equilibrium conditions between these two forms of transport are studied in the tradable credits scheme. Public transport priority is highlighted by charging car travelers credits only. The economies of scale presented by the transit system under the tradable credit scheme are analyzed by comparing the marginal cost and average cost. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the model. Furthermore, the effects of tradable credits schemes on bus investment and travelers' modal choice behavior are explored based on scenario discussions.

@article{FengXiao.2013,
 abstract = {We demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of a tradable credit system in managing the morning commute congestion with identical and nonidentical commuters. The credit system consists of a time-varying credit charged at the bottleneck and an initial credit distribution to the commuters, where the credits are universal in terms of time. Credits are tradable between the commuters and the credit price is determined by a competitive market. Under the assumption that late-arrival is not allowed, we prove that an optimal credit charging scheme, which completely eliminates the bottleneck queue, always exists despite how commuters vary in their value-of-time (VOT). The optimal charge rate is strictly increasing and convex with time, which therefore drives the commuters to depart in the increasing order of their VOT. The optimal credit charging scheme is pareto-improving, but may cause undesirable welfare distribution among the commuters. Our study shows that a combination of an initial credit distribution and an optimal credit charging scheme can simultaneously achieve system optimum and certain forms of equality (e.g., {\textquotedbl}numerical{\textquotedbl} or {\textquotedbl}proportional{\textquotedbl} equality), and that the commuters in the middle VOT bracket will receive the most credits under the proportionally equitable credit distribution. {\copyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The value of travel time is an important element in cost-benefit analysis of transportation projects, by encapsulating the willingness to pay of the population for improvements in the transport system. Those values are typically obtained from mobility behavior data from revealed or stated preference surveys. Although short-term decisions are typically used for this purpose, a growing number of authors is arguing that long-term decisions might provide more meaningful values for the evaluation of transportation projects, as those decisions have a longer-lasting effect on the experienced travel times. This paper uses data which contains both short- and long-term experiments to investigate the impact of different time horizons on the valuation of time. Using a joint model including all short term, together with workplace choice situations, the differences in the valuation of time coming from different kinds of experiments are investigated. The results reveal difficulties to isolate the willingness to pay from other aspects of monetary compensation, such as income as a status or career progression symbol. The results confirm that the chosen time horizon has a significant effect on the valuation of travel time and cost. The richer data, compared to previous attempts at such an estimation, does reveal, however, potential pitfalls in the underlying theory, namely that there is a perfect substitution between travel costs and income. In particular, focusing on salary neutral situations instead of situations with salary gains changes the direction of the effect of long term decisions. Recommendations are derived for forthcoming studies.}

This paper reviews recent developments in the application of SP models which add to their growing relevance in demand modelling and prediction. The main themes addressed include a comparative assessment of choice models and preference models, the importance of scaling when pooling different types of data, especially the appeal of SP data as an enriching strategy in the context of revealed preference models, hierarchical designs when the number of attributes make single experiments too complex for the respondent, and ways of accommodating dynamics (i.e. serial correlation and state dependence) in SP modelling.},

abstract = {Although transport externalities are known to be substantial, their estimates are uncertain, especially when comparing modes. This paper presents a comprehensive approach to assess the external costs of various modes of transportation, including public transport, motorized individual transport, sharing services, and active mobility. The methodology also covers multiple external cost categories, namely air pollution, climate, noise, land use, congestion, accidents and barrier costs, as well as the health benefits of active mobility. The city of Munich, Germany, serves as a case study to calculate the total external costs of transportation per year. Furthermore, the developed approach allows the assessment of transport policy scenarios to investigate the impacts of changes in the mobility system, such as modal shifts or electrification. In Munich, diesel and gasoline cars cause almost 80% of all external costs. Increasing the active mobility share is more beneficial in terms of external cost reductions than increasing the public transport share or electrification rate.}

 abstract = {The paper presents a comprehensive review on a variety of tradable mobility permits (TMP) schemes that are proposed as an innovative way of allocating roadway capacity. The study develops a comparative analysis and a qualitative evaluation to identify the similarities and variations among various TMP schemes. The paper summarizes both the strength and the weakness of different TMP schemes with respect to congestion reduction, market mechanism, and equity issues. A comparison between three typical TMP schemes and congestion pricing (CP) yields the following main conclusions: (i) there is no general superiority between the TMP schemes and the CP; (ii) various TMP schemes are unlikely to be combined into a general one, and should be separately designed for the particular objective and application condition; and (iii) different TMP schemes have different parts to be emphasized in the system design. The paper points out the implications for designs of pragmatic TMP schemes and the future research. $\backslash$textcopyright 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},
